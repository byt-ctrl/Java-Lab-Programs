   -> Write a non static method to access the static varibale into the same . ( must be user input )


8. Create a class person with private instance variables name and age . Implement public getter and setter methods for these variables . Demonstrate how to access
 | and modify these varibles from another class . Add few more variables into the same with the diffrent access specifier and test the results.( must be user input )
